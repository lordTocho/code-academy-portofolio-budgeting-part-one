# Portfolio requirements
The document contains all of the different requirements that need to be met for the application. Plus a good way for me to figure out the different parts.

Using the [Envelope budgeting method](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-envelope-budgeting-1293682)

* Be able to create, read, update, and delete envelopes
* Update envlope balances( have condition to check if the user is going to exceed the amount )
* Transfer budgets from different envelopes( have a condition to make sure that the user does not exceed balance )
* Retrieve all your envelopes( return envelope balance )
* Retrieve specific envelopes( return envelope balance )
